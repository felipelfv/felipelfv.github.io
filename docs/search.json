More specifically, I’m involved with the “structural-after-measurement” (SAM) approach and its extensions in the context of nonlinear effects. My advisor is Prof. Yves Rosseel (yes, the lavaan guy). Besides that, I’m also a co-lead together with some wonderful people for one team at Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT)."
