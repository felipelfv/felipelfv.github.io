    "text": "Hello! My name is Felipe. I’m a PhD student in statistical data analysis at G(h)ent University. My main research is about latent interactions. More specifically, I’m involved with the “structural-after-measurement” (SAM) approach and its extensions in the context of nonlinear effects. My supervisor is Prof. Yves Rosseel (yes, the lavaan guy). Besides that, I’m also a co-lead with some wonderful people for one team at Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT)."
